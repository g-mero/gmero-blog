Welcome! This is my personal blog repository where I share thoughts on programming, software tools, useful resources, and bits of life.

## About This Site

Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (a blazing fast static site generator) and styled with my custom [Mori theme](https://github.com/g-mero/hugo-theme-mori).

The site supports both English and Chinese (hopefully one day I'll be a bilingual blogger without relying on translation tools).

## How I Deploy

For regions outside mainland China, I use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) for deployment and hosting. It's fully automatic with very simple configuration, and Cloudflare's free features are absolutely amazing.

For mainland China, I currently use Tencent Cloud LightCos + DogeCloud CDN. The benefit is blazing fast speed with almost no cost. That's why you see TypeScript scripts in my repository — these scripts run automatically via GitHub Actions to handle uploads and CDN cache refreshing. Very convenient, and you might find them useful for your own automated deployment setup.
